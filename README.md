### About Encryption Key

Custom Firmware will not find the Encryption Key. It is something that needs to be obtained in other ways.

### Debug Logs

If you have any problems with signal decryption (or some other problem with my firmware ) and can't figure it out, you need to create debug files and send it to my email.

Separate debug files for each problem separately.

How to create the debug logs:
* Enable logging.
   - Enable logging by pressing the side Menu button > Settings > Set Debug Log Mode > SD Card (File). Select by pressing on the Volume button.
* Include multiple calls together with pauses.
* Disable logging.
   - Deactivate debug logging via the scanner menu Settings > Set Debug Logs Mode > Off. 
* Send Email with problem's description and attached logs.
   - Debug logs can be found on the scanner SD Card in the /BCDx36HP/debug/ directory.

### Virus/Trojan false warning

Some Windows users are triggered by the built-in antivirus when working with the file "alice.cft". This warning is false, which you can verify by checking this file with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload), an online service that combines a huge number of antivirus checks.

### Demo Limitations

* Session time limit - 2 minutes of decrypted voice of any protocols (then turn Off and On device, up to a total of 2 hours)
* Key limit - 5 pcs

If you are not satisfied with the limitations of the demo mode, you can purchase unlock keys for the protocol you need. Each unlock key is unique per the Scanner's ESN.

### Donation / Payments

If your scanner model is not supported, but you want to enjoy these features, or you just want to support the project, you are more than welcome to donate or purchase unlock keys.
